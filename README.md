# jeopardy-labs-category-hider
I host a quiz show that uses https://jeopardylabs.com/ and I typically want the categories hidden so I can reveal them in appropriate manner for the participants.
This is done through Google Chrome JS Snippets & Javascript that uses picsum images to hide the categories until a certain key is pressed to remove it.
